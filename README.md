# Swift-Smart-String-Search
This Extension, lets you search a string with a better options than Contains.
Its a "Google" Like search. For example, if you have the string "I Love to drink Water",
and you try to use contains as a filter to see if you have the phrase "Love Water" inside, 
will say its false, My smart search extension, would say true, because it was done with the 
internet of having a smart search for filtering a collection in terms of more than one word, 
and enabling those words to be separated.

See Playground file for various examples.
